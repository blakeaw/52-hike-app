# 52-hike-app

This is my 52 Hike Challenge Data App powered by Streamlit. 

The app is designed to load hike data from a Google Sheet via its sharing link. Once data is loaded it will highlight your progress, try to generate some graphs from data like the distance and duration, as well as highlight important 52 Hike Challenge milestones.

If you are interested in using the app for your own 52 Hike Challenge data you can try it out for free on the Streamlit Community Cloud at:
